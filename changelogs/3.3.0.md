## [3.3.0](https://github.com/Kevin-Lee/sbt-devoops/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20-label%3Adeclined%20milestone%3Am39) - 2025-10-11

### Changes

* Upgrade `kind-projector` from `0.13.3` to `0.13.4` (#478)
  * `2.13._`: `0.13.3` => `0.13.4`
  * `2.12.(_ >= 8)`: `0.13.3` => `0.13.4`
  * `2.11.12`: `0.13.3` => `0.13.4`

### Fixed

* Type inference issue with `kind-polymorphic Nothing` in Scala `2.13.17` (#480)

  For `F[*]`, there might be a compile-time warning like
  ```
  a type was inferred to be kind-polymorphic `Nothing` to conform to `F[*]`
  ```
  So the following suggested workaround `scalacOptions` was added for Scala `2.13.17`.
  ```
  "-Wconf:cat=lint-infer-any&msg=kind-polymorphic[\\s]+`Nothing`:s"
  ```

### Internal Housekeeping

* Bump `sbt` to `1.11.7` (#482)
